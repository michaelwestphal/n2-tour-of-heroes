# ng2-tour-of-heroes
This repo tracks my progress for the completion of the [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) tutorial entitled "[Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/)".

I also utilized the [`angular-cli`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to get a feel for how that project works. This is a step not part of the tutorial steps, but one I chose to add.

## Steps

To run this repo, perform the following steps:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

Please see the scripts present in the `package.json` for more options and the [usage](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#usage) section of the `angular-cli` project.
